## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

See the full [testing guide](./playwright-tests/README.md).

## Project Structure

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope), a custom Google Font.

### Routes

This project uses the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), and so the routes are defined in the `app` folder. There are three main pages:

- `/`: Home page of the application. It displays a list of projects that are available on the NEAR platform.
- `/project/:projectId`: Displays the details of a specific project. It includes information about the project, such as the name, description, and the list of tags associated with the project.
- `/category/:categoryId`: Displays a list of projects that are associated with a specific category.
- `/bookmarks`: Shows your projects bookmarked in local storage

### Global State

[zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is used to manage global state. It is a state management library that provides a simple and scalable solution for managing application state in a React or Preact application.

The state is stored in the `store` folder. There are two stores that are used in this project:

- `search-store.ts`: Manages the search state, including the search query and the tags that are selected.
- `tags-modal-store.ts`: Manages the state of the tags modal for mobile devices.
- `search-modal-store.ts`: Manages the state of search modal.
